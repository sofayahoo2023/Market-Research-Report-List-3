<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Adhesion Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid adhesion barriers are used in surgery to prevent post-operative adhesions. Absorbable barriers are designed to break down and be absorbed by the body over time, eliminating the need for removal. Non-absorbable barriers, on the other hand, remain in place permanently. Both types of barriers serve the same purpose of creating a physical barrier between tissues to prevent adhesions from forming, but their longevity and removal requirements differ. Surgeons may choose between absorbable and non-absorbable barriers based on patient needs and surgical preferences.</p></p>
