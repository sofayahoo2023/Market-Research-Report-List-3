<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tibial Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mobile-bearing</li><li>Fixed-bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tibial bearings are components used in knee replacement surgeries. The market for these bearings can be categorized into two types - mobile-bearing and fixed-bearing. In mobile-bearing knee implants, the plastic bearing is designed to move within the metal implant, allowing more natural joint movement. Fixed-bearing knee implants, on the other hand, have a stationary plastic bearing fixed onto the metal implant. These different types of tibial bearings provide surgeons with options to choose the most suitable implant for each patient based on factors such as individual anatomy and stability requirements.</p></p>
