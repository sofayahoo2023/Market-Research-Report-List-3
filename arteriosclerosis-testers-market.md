<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arteriosclerosis Testers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PWV</li><li>CF-PWV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Arteriosclerosis testers measure arterial stiffness and identify potential cardiovascular risks. There are two main types of tests in the market: Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) and Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (CF-PWV). PWV measures the speed at which arterial pressure waves travel along a specific artery, providing information on arterial stiffness. CF-PWV specifically measures the velocity of pressure waves traveling between the carotid and femoral arteries, offering a more detailed assessment of central arterial stiffness and cardiovascular health.</p></p>
