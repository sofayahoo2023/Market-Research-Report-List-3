<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioresorbable Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metals</li><li>Polymers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bioresorbable implants are medical devices that are designed to be gradually absorbed by the body over time. There are two main types of materials used in the bioresorbable implants market: metals and polymers. Metal bioresorbable implants are made from materials like magnesium and iron, which gradually dissolve and are replaced by natural bone or tissue. Polymer bioresorbable implants, on the other hand, are made from synthetic materials that break down over time, allowing natural healing and tissue regeneration. Both types of implants offer advantages such as reduced risk of infection and elimination of the need for implant removal surgeries.</p></p>
