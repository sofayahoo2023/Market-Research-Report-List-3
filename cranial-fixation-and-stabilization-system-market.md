<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Fixation and Stabilization System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonresorbable</li><li>Resorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cranial fixation and stabilization systems are used in neurosurgery to secure the skull bones in place. Nonresorbable systems are made of materials like titanium or stainless steel, providing long-term stability but requiring removal in a separate procedure. Resorbable systems, on the other hand, are made of materials like polymers that gradually break down over time, eliminating the need for a second surgery. Both types of systems have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific needs of the patient.</p></p>
