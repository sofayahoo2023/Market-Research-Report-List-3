<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tubular Quench Method</li><li>Flat Film Strength Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP) is produced through two different methods - Tubular Quench Method and Flat Film Strength Method. The Tubular Quench Method involves extruding molten polypropylene through a circular die, then rapidly cooling it to form a tube. The tube is then stretched in both directions to orient the molecules. In the Flat Film Strength Method, the molten polypropylene is extruded as a flat film, which is then stretched in two directions to achieve biaxial orientation. Both methods result in BOPP films with enhanced strength, stiffness, and transparency.</p></p>
