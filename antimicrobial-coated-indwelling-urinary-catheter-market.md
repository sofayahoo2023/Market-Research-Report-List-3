<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antimicrobial Coated Indwelling Urinary Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Antibiotic Coating</li><li>Silver Ion Coating</li><li>Protein Nano Bacteriostatic Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Antimicrobial coated indwelling urinary catheters are medical devices designed to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections. There are three main types of coatings used in these catheters - antibiotic coating, silver ion coating, and protein nano bacteriostatic coating. Antibiotic coatings release antibiotics to prevent bacterial growth, silver ion coatings release silver ions with antimicrobial properties, and protein nano bacteriostatic coatings disrupt the cell membranes of bacteria. These coatings help inhibit bacterial colonization on the catheter surface, reducing the risk of infection for patients.</p></p>
