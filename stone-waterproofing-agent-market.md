<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stone Waterproofing Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based</li><li>Water Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stone waterproofing agents can be categorized into two main types: solvent-based and water-based. Solvent-based waterproofing agents are primarily made up of chemicals dissolved in a solvent, providing a strong and durable waterproofing barrier on stone surfaces. On the other hand, water-based agents use water as a carrier for the chemicals, making them eco-friendly and easier to apply. Both types offer protection against water damage, but solvent-based agents are known for their long-lasting effects, while water-based agents are considered more environmentally friendly.</p></p>
