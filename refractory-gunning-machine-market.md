<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refractory Gunning Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Powder Mixing</li><li>Wet Mixing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Refractory Gunning Machine market consists of two main types: Dry Powder Mixing and Wet Mixing. Dry Powder Mixing machines are designed to mix dry materials with water on-site to create a homogenous refractory mixture, which is then sprayed onto surfaces using compressed air. Wet Mixing machines, on the other hand, involve pre-mixing the refractory material with water before loading it into the machine for spraying. Both types of machines are essential for applying refractory materials in industries such as steel, cement, and ceramics.</p></p>
