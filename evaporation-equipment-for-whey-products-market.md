<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Evaporation Equipment for Whey Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Evaporator Drying</li><li>Straight Through Spray Drying</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Evaporator drying is a process in which whey products are concentrated using evaporators, which remove water from the liquid product to create a more concentrated form. This method is commonly used for higher solid content products. Straight through spray drying involves atomizing the whey product into small droplets and drying them quickly in a heated chamber, resulting in a fine powder. This method is often preferred for producing powdered whey products with lower moisture content. Both methods are crucial in the whey product industry for processing and preserving the products.</p></p>
