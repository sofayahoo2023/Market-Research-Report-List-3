<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Digital Isolators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capacitive Coupling</li><li>Magnetic Coupling</li><li>Giant Magnetoresistive GMR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial digital isolators are devices used to provide electrical isolation between input and output circuits in industrial applications. There are three main types of industrial digital isolators based on the method of isolation: capacitive coupling, magnetic coupling, and Giant Magnetoresistive (GMR). Capacitive coupling isolators use a capacitive barrier to isolate the input and output circuits. Magnetic coupling isolators use a transformer to transfer signals across the isolation barrier. GMR isolators utilize a GMR sensor to achieve high levels of isolation and signal integrity.</p></p>
