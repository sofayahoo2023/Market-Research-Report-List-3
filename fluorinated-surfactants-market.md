<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluorinated Surfactants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ionic Type</li><li>Non-ionic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluorinated surfactants can be categorized into two main types: ionic type and non-ionic type. Ionic type surfactants contain charged functional groups that help in reducing surface tension and improving wetting properties. Non-ionic type surfactants do not contain charged groups and are generally less sensitive to variations in pH levels. Both types play vital roles in various industries such as chemical, textile, and personal care, where they are used for applications like foaming, emulsifying, and dispersing.</p></p>
